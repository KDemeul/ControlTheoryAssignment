\subsubsection{Exercise}

We want to design a lead-lag controller which eliminates the static control error for a step response in the reference signal.

The controller transfer function is the following:

$$ F(s) = K \frac{\tau_D s + 1}{\beta \tau_D s + 1} \frac{\tau_I s + 1}{\tau_I s + \gamma}$$

We want to fulfill the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Phase margin of $30^{\circ}$ at the cross-over frequency $\omega_c = 0.4$ rad/s.
 \item No static control error for a step response 
\end{itemize}
