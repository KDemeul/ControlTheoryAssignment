\emph{Abstract} -- 
This paper resume our work for the first homework in the course \emph{Control, Theory \& Practice}. 
In the first part we deal with controlling a simple single-input/single-output (SISO) system. 
In the second part, we still have a SISO system but we have to take care of the disturbances, rising the difficulty to design the controller.
