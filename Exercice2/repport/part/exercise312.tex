\paragraph{Minimum phase model}

Poles and zeros of the multivariable system in the minimum phase model case are:

$$
\text{Poles}(G_{mp}(s)) = 
    \left(\begin{array}{c}  
    -.056 \text{ (double)} \\
    -.052 \text{ (double)} \\
    -.021 \\
    -.026 \\
    \end{array}\right)
$$
$$
\text{Zeros}(G_{mp}(s)) = 
    \left(\begin{array}{c}
    -.0093 \\
    -.038 \\
    -.056 \\
    -.052 \\
    \end{array}\right)
$$

\paragraph{Non-minimum phase model}

Poles and zeros of the multivariable system in the non-minimum phase model case are:

$$
\text{Poles}(G_{nmp}(s)) = \left(\begin{array}{c} -.051 \text{ (double)}\\ -.047 \text{ (double)} \\-.091 \\ -.086\\ \end{array}\right)
$$
$$
\text{Zeros}(G_{nmp}(s)) = \left(\begin{array}{c} -.24\\ .059\\ -.051\\ -.047 \end{array}\right)
$$

We see that there is one zero of $G_{nmp}(s)$ is in the right-hand side of the complex plane.
Therefore the system is \emph{(indeed)} a non-minimum phase systems.
This system offers a gain in the wrong direction for rapid inputs: the cross over frequency should be small.

Using the rule of thumb defined in the course the bandwith limitation is :
$$
\omega_{BS} \leq \frac{z}{2} = .029
$$
