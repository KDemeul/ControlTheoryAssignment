\subsubsection{Exercise}

As we have seen in the previous exercise, the control performance are better in the minimum phase case. 
(Even if its a bad idea in most cases to implement a decentralized controller).
Moreover since the non-minimum phase system presents a zero in the RHP it is more complicated to design this kind of controller
