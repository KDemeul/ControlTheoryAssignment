\subsection{Decentralized control}

In this section we will investigate the control of the four-tank process with a decentralized control. 

\paragraph{Minimum phase system}

In the minimum phase system the input $u_1$ is coupled with $y_1$ and $u_2$ is coupled with $y_2$. 

We will therefore use:

$$F_m(s) = \left[\begin{array}{cc} f_1(s) & 0 \\ 0 & f_2(s) \end{array}\right]$$

\paragraph{Non-minimum phase system}

In the non-minimum phase system the input $u_1$ is coupled with $y_2$ and $u_2$ is coupled with $y_1$. 

We will therefore use:

$$F_{nm}(s) = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & f_1(s) \\ f_2(s) & 0 \end{array}\right]$$
