\subsection{Poles, zeros and RGA}

The system is modelized as a MIMO system with two inputs ($u_1 \& u_2$) and two ouputs ($y_1 \& y_2$).
The multivariable model with $2$ inputs and $2$ outputs is given by $Y(s) = G(s)U(s)$.
Depending on the settings of the valves -- minimum/maximum phase model -- we obtain different $G(s)$.
Each exercise in the following take care of the two settings.
