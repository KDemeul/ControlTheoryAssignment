\emph{Abstract} -- 
This paper summarizes our work for the second homework in the course \emph{Control, Theory \& Practice}. 
In this exercise linear models of a four-tank process is investigated for two different settings of the valves (see Figure \ref{tank}).
The first part deals with the analysis of the poles and zeros of the system.
The second part deals with the decentralized control of the system.
