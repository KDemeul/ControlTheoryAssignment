\emph{Abstract} -- 
\emph{
This report summarize the work made during the laboratories projects in \emph{Control Theory and Practice}.
In this laboratories experiments we control a four-tank process, a multivariable system.
At first, we model the system. 
Then we propose and perform experiments to determine the some parameters of the system.
Secondly, we compute and analyse the performances of 4 differents controllers (control recquirements were provided in \cite{subject}).
