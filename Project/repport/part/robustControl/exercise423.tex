\subsubsection{Exercise} 

The main differences between the minimum phase case and the non-minimum phase case using Glover-MacFarlane controllers are (differencies are quiet similar as the one using the decentralized controllers):
\begin{shortitemize}
    \item The non-minimum phase system is much slower (both for step response and disturbance rejection);
    \item Disturbances on the top tanks have more impact on the non-minimum phase system (whereas the perturbation on the lower tanks have a similar impact on both systems).
\end{shortitemize}
