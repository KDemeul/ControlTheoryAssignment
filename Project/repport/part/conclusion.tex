\emph{Conclusion} --
\emph{
    This repport summarized our work about the modelization, design and analysis of controllers for a multivariable system.
    The decentralized controllers offered good control results, and optimizing them with Glover-MacFarlane method leads to really good control performances and satisfying robustness and stability.
    The experiments was the opportunity to ``get our hand dirty'' by controlling a real system (not only simulation).
