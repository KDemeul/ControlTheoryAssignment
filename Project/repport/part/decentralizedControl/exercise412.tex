\subsubsection{Exercise} 

The main differences between the minimum phase case and the non-minimum phase case using a decentralized controller are:
\begin{shortitemize}
    \item The non-minimum phase system is a lot more slower (both for step response and disturbance rejection);
    \item The step response of the non-minimum phase system start by decreasing its value (wrong direction!);
    \item Disturbances on the top tanks have more impact on the non-minimum phase system (whereas the perturbation on the lower tanks have a similar impact on both systems).
\end{shortitemize}
