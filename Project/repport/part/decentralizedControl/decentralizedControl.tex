In the following section we will test our decentralized controllers and analyse the impact of externals perturbations (pouring a cup of water in one of the lower tank and opening an extra outlet in one of the upper tanks).

Our controller are used in small deviation cases ($\approx 5\%$) around the equilibrium point (set as $50\%$ for each pump). 

For Figures \ref{min_dyn_fig} to \ref{nonmin_glover_fig}, each of the following experiment is done:
\begin{shortitemize}
    \item Step response relative to input 1,
    \item Cup of water in tank 1,
    \item Extra outlet in tank 3.
\end{shortitemize}
