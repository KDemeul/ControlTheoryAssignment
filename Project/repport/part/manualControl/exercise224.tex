\subsubsection{Exercise}

From the previous exercises, we can formulate the following conclusions:
\begin{shortitemize}
\item The coupling exists in both case,
\item The coupling is more important in the non-minimum phase case ($3.9 \geq 2.9$ and $4.6 \geq 2.2$)
\item The transient time is smaller in the non-minimum phase case (for manual control). This result seems surprising. Indeed, we would have expect to find a faster system in the minimum phase case (since filling the lower tanks is mostly made by emptying the upper tanks in the non-minimum phase case).
\end{shortitemize}
